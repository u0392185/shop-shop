Redux, as we'll soon see:

    Single source of truth
    State is read-only
    State is changed through pure functions



The name for a global state object is often referred to as a store.

As we learned earlier, a global store is built on two important pieces when it comes to updating state:

    Actions: These define the types of events that can be emitted to update state. State can only be updated if it's a predefined action.
    Reducers: The actual functionality that carries out the emitted action to update state.


The Provider is a special type of React component that we wrap our application in so it can make the state data that's passed into it as a prop available to all other components. The Consumer is our means of grabbing and using the data that the Provider holds for us.


The second argument in useEffect is known as the dependency array.
    [products, data, dispatch, id])
